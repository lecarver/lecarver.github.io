> Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. - Wikipedia
